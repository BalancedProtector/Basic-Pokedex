Welcome to Steven Martins Basic Pokedex
This program relies on Bootstrap, Popper, jQuery, JavaScript, CSS and HTML
Along with the Fetch and Promise Polyfil sections. 
Using ESLint to assist in a standard coding style

This pokedex is for sure nothing special but it should be looked at from the perspective of a complete beginner. 
Which is what I was just a few short months ago. This Pokedex lists the first 150 Pokemon onto your web page for you to see. 

You can click on any pokemon on the screen and it will bring forth a modal to show more details on the pokemon that you clicked. 
The data that is shown is also very basic. 
Height, weight, types, and abilities. 
While also showing both the front and back sprites.
This project will be hosted on github pages and linked to from my portfolio website.
